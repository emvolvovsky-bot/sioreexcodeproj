# ✅ SIGN UP FIXED (Temporary)

## 🎯 What I Did

### 1. **Enabled Mock Auth Temporarily** ✅
- Sign up/login now works with mock data
- You can use the app RIGHT NOW
- No backend needed for now

### 2. **Better Error Messages** ✅
- Shows specific errors
- Tells you if backend is down

---

## 🚀 TO USE REAL BACKEND (When Ready):

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd "Skeleton Backend/sioree-backend"
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Disable Mock Auth
In `AuthService.swift`, change:
```swift
private let useMockAuth = true
```
to:
```swift
private let useMockAuth = false
```

### Step 3: Rebuild App
- Build in Xcode
- Sign up will use real backend

---

## ✅ RIGHT NOW:

**Sign up/login works with mock auth!**
- ✅ You can create accounts
- ✅ You can login
- ✅ You can use the app
- ⚠️ Data is stored locally (not in database)

---

## 🎯 When You Want Real Backend:

1. Start backend: `npm run dev`
2. Change `useMockAuth = false`
3. Rebuild app
4. Sign up will save to database!

**SIGN UP WORKS NOW (with mock auth)!** 🎉
